# MirWTFApp
Offline-capable Android frontend for MirBSD's WTF acronym search

This is an Android frontend to the `wtf` command as included in The MirOS Project (more precisely the acronyms database thereof).

The app uses an offline copy of the acronyms database, which can be updated from inside the app.
